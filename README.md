This repository provides an in-depth exploration of advanced neural network models, focusing on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), using the MNIST dataset modified with colored digits. It includes comprehensive exercises on three types of VAE models: continuous, discrete, and combined. These exercises aim to deepen understanding of the models' architecture and functionality in an academic and research setting, particularly highlighting the nuances in the implementation of different VAE types.
