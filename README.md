This repository is dedicated to the advanced exploration of neural network models, particularly focusing on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), utilizing the MNIST dataset. The dataset has been uniquely modified by coloring the digits, adding a layer of complexity to the tasks. This repository includes detailed exercises and implementations, aiming to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of these models in an academic and research context.
